		    	<p>Combi boilers, or ‘combination boilers’ as they are known are the most popular type of boiler in the UK. In fact, they’re so popular that they’re used by 74% of households across the country! </p>
		    	<p>They're named ‘combination' because they combine both a high-efficiency water heater and a central heating boiler all in one simple package and they are highly efficient. Also, combi boilers can save you lots of money on your heating bills so they’re a great option for those looking to save some money.</p>
		    	<p>That's because:</p>
		    	<ul>
		    		<li>They heat the water only when you need it, rather than storing hot water up like traditional boilers</li>
		    		<li>They're small and compact, as they don't use an external hot water tank so are great for those living in apartments or for those with limited space.</li>

		       What are thermostatic radiator valves (TRV’s)? Do I need them?
		      </button>
		    </h5>
		  </div>
		  <div id="collapseEight" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingEight" data-parent="#accordion">
		    <div class="card-body">
		      <p>Thermostatic radiator valves – or TRVs as they’re most commonly known – are controls for your radiators. They regulate how much hot water flows into the radiator so you can adjust its temperature. If you’d rather have it hotter in one room than another, simply alter the dial accordingly.</p>
		      <p>TRVs also let you turn some radiators off (for Nine, in a room you're not using) without completely turning the heating off.</p>
		      <p><b>Why do I need TRVs?</b></p>
		      <p>The Government recommends that every household has thermostatic radiator valves because they:</p>
		      <ul>
		      	<li>Save you money on heating bills</li>
		      	<li>Use less energy</li>
		      	<li>Are more energy efficient and are better for the environmen</li>
		      </ul>
		      <p>But they're not mandatory, so if you don’t have them don’t worry too much. TRV’s simply give you more control over your home heating.</p>
		      <p><b>How much do they cost?</b></p>
		      <p>Each individual valve costs £35. If you don't have them already installed in your home, we can include them in your package and install them for you. You'll get one for each bedroom, meaning you’ll never have to wake up to a cold house again!</p>
		      <p><b>What if I want TRV’S for other rooms too?</b></p>
		      <p>You can change the number of TRVs you receive before you complete your purchase, so if this is the case, just let us know! </p>
		      <p><b>What if I don’t want any TRV’s installed?</b></p>
		      <p>Not a problem at all! Just make sure you remove them from your boiler package before you purchase or speak to one of our friendly advisors. </p>

		    <div class="card-body">
		      <p>A flue is a pipe, almost like a chimney, that carries waste from the boiler to the outside. You can see your flue exit (the part of the flue that comes out of your house) on the outside wall or roof of your home.</p>
		      <p>Flues can either be round or square depending on the home that you live in.</p>
		      <p>If the flue is less than two metres off the ground, or if it’s underneath a car park or shelter, it'll be covered by a guard. It will include a piece of wire mesh that surrounds the flue.</p>
		      When you buy a boiler from 24|7 Staywarm, we'll supply and fit a brand new flue for you, along with all the safety attachments you need, so you don’t need to worry about any part of your central heating system.
