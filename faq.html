                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p>In designing our service plan, we decided to become fully independent but still operate the similar
                            underwriting model as required by the insurance industry.</p>
                        <p>As a service provider 24|7 Home Rescue operates as a non-insurance registered entity. This is a very
                            important attribute in keeping our operating costs to a minimum and it also means we keep can
                            keep our prices as low as possible for our customers.</p>
                        <p>Traditional warranty companies usually operate on an insured basis and are either owned or contracted
                            to an insurance company.</p>
                        <p>An important aspect of a 24|7 Home Rescue plan is that we insist on controlling the business, and
                            to this end we, both contractually and legally, operate on a completely discretionary basis.</p>
                        <p>We believe that this provides us with more power than we would otherwise have when operating under
                            the strict controls of insurance underwriters. We use this discretion to ensure that you, as
                            our customer, receive a fair and equitable resolution to each and every request you make.</p>
                        <p>Insurance policies are typically designed with deliberate ambiguity, in order to give underwriters
                            the power to dispute or disallow claims and repairs. This allows insurers to reduce their pay-outs
                            and control their cost base.</p>
                        <p>We believe we use our discretion wisely, so we can best meet the interests of our customers and provide
                            them with a much fairer service. By doing so, we can protect ourselves against fraud and extend
                            our service so we can deal with any given situation.</p>

                        <p>At 24|7 Home Rescue, we’re looking to revolutionise the way you pay for a boiler. Traditionally,
                            replacing an old boiler could cost upwards of £3,000 and that’s simply for the boiler itself
                            without any maintenance or emergency cover costs. For most people, it’s simply unaffordable and
                            forces people to pay hundreds in repairs for an old boiler which is uneconomical. </p>

                        <p>The ‘ERP’ – Energy related products label will tell you how efficiently your boiler (or any other

                            right appliance and is designed to ensure you save the most money on your heating and energy
                            bills. The ERP label will rate an appliance from A+++ to G.</p>
                        <p>A+++ is the most efficient boiler you can get.</p>
                        <p>It also tells you how loud the appliance is in decibels and how much heat it outputs in kilowatts.</p>

                        <p>Combi boilers, or ‘combination boilers’ as they are known are the most popular type of boiler in
                            the UK. In fact, they’re so popular that they’re used by 74% of households across the country!
                            </p>
                        <p>They're named ‘combination' because they combine both a high-efficiency water heater and a central
                            heating boiler all in one simple package and they are highly efficient. Also, combi boilers can
                            save you lots of money on your heating bills so they’re a great option for those looking to save
                            some money.</p>
                        <p>That's because:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They heat the water only when you need it, rather than storing hot water up like traditional
                                boilers</li>
                            <li>They're small and compact, as they don't use an external hot water tank so are great for those
                                living in apartments or for those with limited space.</li>

                        <p>Thermostatic radiator valves – or TRVs as they’re most commonly known – are controls for your radiators.
                            They regulate how much hot water flows into the radiator so you can adjust its temperature. If
                            you’d rather have it hotter in one room than another, simply alter the dial accordingly.</p>
                        <p>TRVs also let you turn some radiators off (for Nine, in a room you're not using) without completely
                            turning the heating off.</p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Why do I need TRVs?</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Government recommends that every household has thermostatic radiator valves because they:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Save you money on heating bills</li>
                            <li>Use less energy</li>
                            <li>Are more energy efficient and are better for the environmen</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>But they're not mandatory, so if you don’t have them don’t worry too much. TRV’s simply give you
                            more control over your home heating.</p>
                        <p>
                            <b>How much do they cost?</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>Each individual valve costs £35. If you don't have them already installed in your home, we can include
                            them in your package and install them for you. You'll get one for each bedroom, meaning you’ll
                            never have to wake up to a cold house again!</p>
                        <p>
                            <b>What if I want TRV’S for other rooms too?</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>You can change the number of TRVs you receive before you complete your purchase, so if this is the
                            case, just let us know! </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>What if I don’t want any TRV’s installed?</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>Not a problem at all! Just make sure you remove them from your boiler package before you purchase
                            or speak to one of our friendly advisors. </p>

                        <p>A flue is a pipe, almost like a chimney, that carries waste from the boiler to the outside. You can
                            see your flue exit (the part of the flue that comes out of your house) on the outside wall or
                            roof of your home.</p>
                        <p>Flues can either be round or square depending on the home that you live in.</p>
                        <p>If the flue is less than two metres off the ground, or if it’s underneath a car park or shelter,
                            it'll be covered by a guard. It will include a piece of wire mesh that surrounds the flue.</p>
                        When you buy a boiler from 24|7 Staywarm, we'll supply and fit a brand new flue for you, along with all the safety attachments
                        you need, so you don’t need to worry about any part of your central heating system.

                        Your boiler warranty will only be valid if you have a boiler service regularly. This usually consists of having a boiler
                        service at least once a year. 24|7 Staywarm also offer boiler services to homeowners, tenants and
                        landlords as part of our offering. Please contact our customer service team to find out more.
                        <!-- 	      <p>You can also request a boiler service from your boiler manufacturer. Please bear in mind, these can be expensive and usually have long waiting times. If in doubt, refer to your instruction manual as to how best to book a maintenance visit.</p> -->
